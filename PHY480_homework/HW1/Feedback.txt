# HW grading scale: check(++) --> excellent (good code and analysis AND also completed bonus problem)  
#                   check(+) --> excellent (good code and analysis)  
#                   check    --> satisfactory (minor shortcomings in code and/or analysis)
#                   check(-) --> significant problems w/code or analysis

1) Problem 1 (area.cpp embellishments): 

Your code looks ok to me.  

2)Problem 2 (sum up/down): 

Your figure and output data looks off. Your code is a little bit confusing. There is no loop over
N and the summing up and summing down calculations should be put into separate functions (i.e.,
not coded in the main program).
 

3) Problem 3 (bessel functions): 

The figure seems way off. You might want to double check your code/plotting of the data.  


4) Extra problem (roundoff distribution):
NA

##### HW grade = check(-)
 

Upgrade your grade: Fix the problems with problems 2 and 3 to get a check(+). Additionally do the bonus for a check(++).
